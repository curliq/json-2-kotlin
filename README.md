# Json2Kotlin

Converts a JSON string into Kotlin data classes.

## About

As you've probably guessed by now, this project automatically converts JSON to Kotlin source files. 
The tool itself is implemented 100% in Kotlin, and makes heavy use of Square's excellent [KotlinPoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet) library.
        
Read <a href="https://fractalwrench.co.uk/posts/json-2-kotlin/">the blog post</a> which covers how this multi-platform tool was written.
